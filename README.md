DL4J Release 0.4 Examples for Scala 
=========================

 This project is a simple Scala porting of [deeplearning4j-0.4-example](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/dl4j-0.4-examples).

The main purpose of this project is:

* Show example of how to use deeplearning4j Java API from scala

* Provide a sbt project template depends on DL4J


Every examples in this demonstration directly calls Java APIs of DL4J.
If you want to write codes in the scala manner strongly,
you should consider to use [deeplearning4s](https://github.com/deeplearning4j/deeplearning4s).

| DBNIris             | 0.67         | 0.8    | full          | 
| DBNMnistFull        | 0.09         | 0.17   | batch         |
| MLPBackpropIris     | 0.82         | 0.81   | full          |
| MLPMnistSingleLayer | 0.91         | 0.91   | batch         |
| RBMIris             |              | NA     | full          |
| TSNEStandard        |              | NA     | NA            |
| Word2VecRawText     |              | NA     | batch         |
    

* Accuracy and F1 depends on how many examples the model is trained on.
